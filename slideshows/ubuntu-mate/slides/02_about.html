      <p>Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a
      configurable desktop environment. Ideal for those who want the
      most out of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop
      metaphor. <br />
      With modest hardware requirements it is suitable for
      modern workstations, single board computers and older hardware
      alike.

      <p>For users coming from other operating systems, Ubuntu MATE can
      adapt the user interface with one-click to something more modern
      or something that you might be more familiar with via
      <strong>MATE Tweak</strong>.</p>
